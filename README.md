# Java 8 Nashorn Examples

This repository contains some Java 8 Nashorn examples, tests and a small
event loop polyfill. Many of the examples in this repository were the basis
for my [enterJS talk](http://www.enterjs.de/abstracts#javascript-und-java-kombinieren-polyglotte-programmierung-auf-jvm).

You can learn more about Java 8 and project Nashorn in my
[upcoming article](https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2014/06/project-nashorn-javascript-jvm-polyglott/)
about code sharing between JavaScript and Java.
